# Install in/as /etc/sysconfig/downtimed
#
OPTIONS=""
# -D
#  Do not create nor update the downtime database.
#
# -d datadir
#  The directory where the time stamp files as well as the downtime database
#  are located. The default directory is determined at compile time.
#
# -F
#  Do not call daemon(3) to fork(2) to background. Useful with modern
#  system service managers such as systemd(8), launchd(8) and others.
#
# OPTIONS="$OPTIONS -F "
#
# -f timefmt
#  Specify the time and date format to use when reporting using
#  strftime(3) syntax. The default is "%F %T".
#
# -l log
#  Logging destination. If the argument contains a slash (/) it is
#  interpreted to be a path name to a log file, which will be created if it
#  does not exist already. Otherwise it is interpreted as a syslog facility
#  name. The default logging destination is "daemon" which means that the
#  messages are written to syslog with the daemon facility code.
#
# -p pidfile
#  The location of the file which keeps track of the process ID of the
#  running daemon process. The system default location is determined at
#  compile time. May be disabled by specifying "none".
#
# -S
#  Normally fsync(2) is performed after each update of the time stamp. This
#  option disables the fsync(2). It reduces the load on the disk system but
#  makes the downtime measurement less reliable.
#
# -s sleep
#  Defines how long to sleep between each update of the on-disk time stamp
#  file. More frequent updates result in more accurate downtime reporting in
#  the case of a system crash. Less frequent updates decrease the amount of
#  disk writes performed. The default is to sleep 15 seconds between each
#  update. If you are using a flash memory based SSD or other disk which has
#  limited amount of write cycles per block, it might be a good idea to set
#  the sleep time to a higher value to prolong the lifetime of the storage
#  device.
